The currently available Sinhala OCR Systems supports only one font style and one font size at a time, when it needs to be processed by the OCR engine. When it comes to an image that contains multi-fonts and multi-size, their wont be any output at all, but in reality most of the documents we find contains at least two types of fonts in at least two sizes of fonts.

The currently available Sinhala OCR engine is unable to handle low quality images with noise and other disturbances, the accuracy is drastically low and sometimes it wonâ€™t even produce an output. Therefore it is a necessity to enhance or come up with a new Sinhala OCR engine which is having the capability of image preprocessing and which supports multi-fonts and multi-size character recognition.
